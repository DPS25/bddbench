    And a target bucket from environment is available            # None
    When I write 10 points with measurement "bddbench_write"     # None
    Then I can read back 10 points with the same run id          # None
    And the average write latency shall be <= 500 ms             # None

Feature: InfluxDB v2 write path performance (POC) # features/write_latency.feature:1
  In order to express performance benchmarks in BDD
  As the team
  I want to define a write workload and check basic latency rules
  Background:   # features/write_latency.feature:6

  @poc @m1 @write
  Scenario Outline: Write load with basic thresholds -- @1.1                        # features/write_latency.feature:19
    Given an InfluxDB endpoint is configured                                        # None

    When I write 200 points per second for 5 seconds                                # None
    Then the median latency shall be <= 50 ms                                       # None
    And I store the benchmark result as "gherkin-poc/reports/write-latency-p1.json" # None
