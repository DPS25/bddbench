Description

Add small Python scripts that benchmark InfluxDB admin endpoints and write KPIs to a common measurement influx_admin_kpi in bucket dsp25 for:

/health (health under sustained load)

/api/v2/delete (delete latency for different time ranges)

/api/v2/users (user-management performance: bulk create/list/delete)

Motivation / Use Case

We want a reproducible way to measure how Influx behaves under real operational workloads (health checks, deletes, user management), detect regressions after upgrades/config changes, and visualize these admin KPIs together with our existing write/query KPIs.

Proposed Solution

Keep three scripts under gherkin-poc/scripts/:

benchmark_health.py – load test /health.

benchmark_delete.py – benchmark /api/v2/delete for a given range/predicate.

benchmark_user_mgmt.py – benchmark bulk /api/v2/users operations.

Each script reads Influx env vars, prints a short summary, and writes exactly one KPI point to influx_admin_kpi with tags like endpoint, scenario, env, host.

Additional Context

/health and /api/v2/delete benchmarks already run successfully on dsp25-wangdong and produce sensible KPIs.

The user-management benchmark works technically, but with the current dev token all POST /api/v2/users calls return 401 (write:users is unauthorized).
